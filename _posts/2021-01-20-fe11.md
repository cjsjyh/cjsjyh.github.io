# Polyfill이란?
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually Javascript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

For example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 using a Silverlight plugin, or mimic support for CSS rem units, or text-shadow, or whatever you want.

ex) core-js, babel/polyfill

# Backend for Frontend (BFF)란?
1. Multiple clients with a single general-purpose server

Very simple but hard to maintain monolithic structure as service grows. Adding new features may cause side effects. Builds and tests take forever to run and it takes days to debug test failures.

2. Multiple clients with a microservices architecture

Microservices are greate for scalability and help solve a bunch of problems. Backend teams are typically responsible for a single service and no longer tripping over each other. Individual microservices are lightweight, customizable, decoupled, and readily extensible

However, there are still boundary issues amongst frontend teams. The responsibility of handling multiple clients is still encoded in one or many services. Frontend engineers are struggling to jam multiple use-cases into a single API layer and the customer experience is beginning to suffer.

3. Multiple clients with dedicated backends and a microservices architecture

Because our clients have very different needs. The BFF applications are lightweight translation layers that decouple individual clients from downstream services and server only a single frontend.

Benefits:
- Frontend teams gets ownership of both their client app and its underlying resource consumption layer.
- Mobile team is able to make changes such as payload size and requeset freqency reduction without having to extend and fork APIs developed for web-based use-cases.
- Encapsulation
